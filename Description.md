# OIB-SIP
This repository showcases the work I did during my  1 month data science internship at Oasis Infobyte. Throughout the internship, I worked on various
projects that involved data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. The experience helped me hone my technical skills and gain 
practical knowledge in the field of data science.
